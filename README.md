# Youngs-Modulus-Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 🎯 Objectives
1. Relationship Between Stress and Strain: Determine the relationship between tensile stress and strain for the given material.

2. Material Properties: Identify the modulus of elasticity, elastic region, plastic region, yield point, and break point from the stress-strain curve.

3. Error Analysis: Understand the types and sources of experimental errors.

4. Measurement Reporting: Accurately report measurements and their uncertainties.

## 📈 Analysis
Stress-Strain Curve:

- The stress-strain curve was plotted using PASCO Capstone and Microsoft Excel.

- The curve revealed two distinct regions:

 1. Elastic Region: Linear relationship between stress and strain.

 2. Plastic Region: Non-linear deformation leading to the break point.

 3. The Young’s Modulus was calculated as 55856 MPa with a percentage error of 19.05% compared to the theoretical value of 69000 MPa.

4. Error Analysis:

- Combined Uncertainty: Calculated for gage length, width, and thickness using standard error and system uncertainty.

- Propagation of Error: Applied to cross-sectional area calculations.

5.  Material Behavior:

- The material exhibited brittle behavior, breaking suddenly with minimal plastic deformation.

- The yield point and break point were identified from the stress-strain curve.

## 📝 Key Findings
1. Material Type: The material is brittle, as it fractured suddenly with only a 0.31% reduction in cross-sectional area.

2. Young’s Modulus: The experimental value of 55856 MPa deviated from the theoretical value by 19.05%, likely due to experimental setup and measurement errors.

3. Stress and Strain: Mechanical stress causes deformation in the material, leading to changes in shape and size until the break point is reached.

4. Weak Point: The middle of the sample experienced the highest tensile stress, making it the most vulnerable to fracture.
